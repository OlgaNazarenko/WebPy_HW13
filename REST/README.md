REST API for storing and managing contacts [^1].

For this project it was used poetry, which is designed for dependency management and packaging in this project. It 
allowed declaring the libraries of this project depends on and manages (install/update) them for you. To activate 
the virtual environment, you need to run the command:

      poetry shell

and then run the following command to start the FastAPI server:

      python3 main.py

If you are facing any issues after running this, please try to refresh the pyptoject.toml by:

      poetry update 

In the code was added the following[^2]:
- An authentication mechanism in the application; 
- An authorization using JWT tokens, so that all operations with contacts are performed only by registered users; 
- The user has access only to his/her operations with contacts.
-
